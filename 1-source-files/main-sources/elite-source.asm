\
\ This lookup table contains sine values for the first half of a circle, from 0
\ to 180 degrees (0 to PI radians). In terms of circle or ellipse line segments,
\ there are 64 segments in a circle, so this contains sine values for segments
\ 0 to 31.
\
\ In terms of segments, to calculate the sine of the angle at segment x, we look
\ up the value in SNE + x, and to calculate the cosine of the angle we look up
\ the value in SNE + ((x + 16) mod 32).
\
\ In terms of radians, to calculate the following:
\
\   sin(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, we look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + (theta * 10)
\
\ To calculate the following:
\
\   cos(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + ((theta * 10) + 16) mod 32
\
\ Theta must be between 0 and 3.1 radians, so theta * 10 is between 0 and 31.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains lookup values for arctangent calculations involving angles
\ in the range 0 to 45 degrees (or 0 to PI / 4 radians).
\
\ To calculate the value of theta in the following:
\
\   theta = arctan(t)
\
\ where 0 <= t < 1, we look up the value in:
\
\   ACT + (t * 32)
\
\ The result will be an integer representing the angle in radians, where 256
\ represents a full circle of 360 degrees (2 * PI radians). The result of the
\ lookup will therefore be an integer in the range 0 to 31, as this represents
\ 0 to 45 degrees (0 to PI / 4 radians).
\
\ The table does not support values of t >= 1 or t < 0 directly, so if we need
\ to calculate the arctangent for an angle greater than 45 degrees, we can apply
\ the following calculation to the result from the table:
\
\   * For t > 1, arctan(t) = 64 - arctan(1 / t)
\
\ For negative values of t where -1 < t < 0, we can apply the following
\ calculation to the result from the table:
\
\   * For t < 0, arctan(-t) = 128 - arctan(t)
\
\ Finally, if t < -1, we can do the first calculation to get arctan(|t|), and
\ the second to get arctan(-|t|).

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

 LDX JSTX               \ Set X to the current rate of roll in JSTX

 JSR cntr               \ Apply keyboard damping twice (if enabled) so the roll
 JSR cntr               \ rate in X creeps towards the centre by 2

                        \ The roll rate in JSTX increases if we press ">" (and
                        \ the RL indicator on the dashboard goes to the right)
                        \
                        \ This rolls our ship to the right (clockwise), but we
                        \ actually implement this by rolling everything else
                        \ to the left (anti-clockwise), so a positive roll rate
                        \ in JSTX translates to a negative roll angle alpha

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * Space and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * TAB to fire an energy bomb
\   * ESCAPE to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\   CNT                 The number of this segment
\
\   STP                 The step size for the circle
\

\
\   FLAG                Set to &FF for the first call, so it sets up the first

\                       drawing anything (as we need two points, i.e. two calls,
\                       before we can draw a line)
\
\   K4(1 0)             Pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\   K5(1 0)             Screen x-coordinate of the previous point added to the
\                       ball line heap (if this is not the first point)
\
\   K5(3 2)             Screen y-coordinate of the previous point added to the

\
\   A                   The new value of CNT

\ This moves the stardust towards us according to our speed (so the dust rushes
\ past us), and applies our current pitch and roll to each particle of dust, so
\ the stardust moves correctly when we steer our ship.
\
\ When a stardust particle rushes past us and falls off the side of the screen,
\ its memory is recycled as a new particle that's positioned randomly on-screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the front view".

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:

\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)

\
\ Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset

\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16

\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y

\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying

\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\

\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

\    Summary: Draw a ship in the ship hangar
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The ship's position within the hangar is determined by the arguments and the
\ size of the ship's targetable area, as follows:
\
\   * The x-coordinate is (x_sign x_hi 0) from the arguments, so the ship can be
\     left of centre or right of centre
\
\   * The y-coordinate is negative and is lower down the screen for smaller
\     ships, so smaller ships are drawn closer to the ground (because they are)
\
\   * The z-coordinate is positive, with both z_hi (which is 1 or 2) and z_lo
\     coming from the arguments
\

\  Deep dive: Program flow of the tactics routine
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section sets up some vectors and calculates dot products. Specifically:
\
\   * If this is a lone Thargon without a mothership, set it adrift aimlessly
\     and we're done
\
\   * If this is a trader, 80% of the time we're done, 20% of the time the
\     trader performs the same checks as the bounty hunter
\
\   * If this is a bounty hunter (or one of the 20% of traders) and we have been
\     really bad (i.e. a fugitive or serious offender), the ship becomes hostile
\     (if it isn't already)
\
\   * If the ship is not hostile, then either perform docking manoeuvres (if
\     it's docking) or fly towards the planet (if it isn't docking) and we're
\     done
\
\   * If the ship is hostile, and a pirate, and we are within the space station
\     safe zone, stop the pirate from attacking by removing all its aggression
\
\   * Calculate the dot product of the ship's nose vector (i.e. the direction it
\     is pointing) with the vector between us and the ship. This value will help
\     us work out later on whether the enemy ship is pointing towards us, and
\     therefore whether it can hit us with its lasers.

\   * If this is an Anaconda, consider spawning (22% chance) a Worm (61% of the
\     time) or a Sidewinder (39% of the time)
\
\   * Rarely (2.5% chance) roll the ship by a noticeable amount
\
\   * If the ship has at least half its energy banks full, jump to part 6 to
\     consider firing the lasers
\
\   * If the ship is not into the last 1/8th of its energy, jump to part 5 to
\     consider firing a missile
\
\   * If the ship is into the last 1/8th of its energy, and this ship type has
\     an escape pod fitted, then rarely (10% chance) the ship launches an escape
\     pod and is left drifting in space

\
\ Calculate the dot product of the vector in XX15 and one of the space station's

\    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
\ the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
\ in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
\
\ Specifically, it calculates the following:
\
\   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\ where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
\ vector for the space station.
\
\ The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
\ -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
\ way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
\ vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
\ of the station to the ship.
\
\ In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
\ actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
\
\ Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
\ the point in front of the station slot.

\ Arguments:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship

\
\   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the
\ centre, and then double the radius, draw another circle, double the radius
\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 2 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ four-colour mode 1 screen.

\    Summary: Calculate (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.
\

\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This prints a specific system's extended description. This is called the "pink
\ volcanoes string" in a comment in the original source, and the "goat soup"
\ recipe by Ian Bell on his website (where he also refers to the species string
\ as the "pink felines" string).
\
\ For some special systems, when you are docked at them, the procedurally
\ generated extended description is overridden and a text token from the RUTOK
\ table is shown instead. If mission 1 is in progress, then a number of systems
\ along the route of that mission's story will show custom mission-related
\ directives in place of that system's normal "goat soup" phrase.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when

\
\ Engage the galactic hyperdrive. Called from the hyp routine above if CTRL-H is
\ being pressed.
\
\ This routine also updates the galaxy seeds to point to the next galaxy. Using
\ a galactic hyperdrive rotates each seed byte to the left, rolling each byte
\ left within itself like this:
\
\   01234567 -> 12345670
\
\ to get the seeds for the next galaxy. So after 8 galactic jumps, the seeds
\ roll round to those of the first galaxy again.
\
\ We always arrive in a new galaxy at galactic coordinates (96, 96), and then
\ find the nearest system and set that as our location.

\    Summary: Project the current ship or planet onto the screen
\  Deep dive: Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Project the current ship's location or the planet onto the screen, either
\ returning the screen coordinates of the projection (if it's on-screen), or
\ returning an error via the C flag.
\
\ In this context, "on-screen" means that the point is projected into the
\ following range:
\
\   centre of screen - 1024 < x < centre of screen + 1024
\   centre of screen - 1024 < y < centre of screen + 1024
\
\ This is to cater for ships (and, more likely, planets and suns) whose centres
\ are off-screen but whose edges may still be visible.
\
\ The projection calculation is:
\
\   K3(1 0) = #X + x / z
\   K4(1 0) = #Y + y / z
\
\ where #X and #Y are the pixel x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the centre of
\ the screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   INWK                The ship data block for the ship to project on-screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K3(1 0)             The x-coordinate of the ship's projection on-screen
\
\   K4(1 0)             The y-coordinate of the ship's projection on-screen
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship's projection doesn't fit on the screen,
\                       clear if it does project onto the screen
\
\   A                   Contains K4+1, the high byte of the y-coordinate

\    Summary: Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse
\  Deep dive: Drawing ellipses
\             Drawing meridians and equators
\             Drawing craters
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse, to be used for the planet's equator and
\ meridian (in which case we draw half an ellipse), or crater (in which case we
\ draw a full ellipse).
\
\ The ellipse is defined by a centre point, plus two conjugate radius vectors,
\ u and v, where:
\
\   u = [ u_x ]       v = [ v_x ]
\       [ u_y ]           [ v_y ]
\
\ The individual components of these 2D vectors (i.e. u_x, u_y etc.) are 16-bit
\ sign-magnitude numbers, where the high bytes contain only the sign bit (in
\ bit 7), with bits 0 to 6 being clear. This means that as we store u_x as
\ (XX16 K2), for example, we know that |u_x| = K2.
\
\ This routine calls BLINE to draw each line segment in the ellipse, passing the
\ coordinates as follows:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + u_x * cos(CNT2) + v_x * sin(CNT2)
\
\   K6(3 2) = K4(1 0) - u_y * cos(CNT2) - v_y * sin(CNT2)
\
\ The y-coordinates are negated because BLINE expects pixel coordinates but the
\ u and v vectors are extracted from the orientation vector. The y-axis runs
\ in the opposite direction in 3D space to that on the screen, so we need to
\ negate the 3D space coordinates before we can combine them with the ellipse's
\ centre coordinates.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(1 0)              The planet's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   K4(1 0)             The pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   (XX16 K2)           The x-component of u (i.e. u_x), where XX16 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+1 K2+1)       The y-component of u (i.e. u_y), where XX16+1 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+2 K2+2)       The x-component of v (i.e. v_x), where XX16+2 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\

\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\

\
\                         * 64 for a full ellipse (a crater)

\  Deep dive: Drawing the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set X1 and X2 to the x-coordinates of the ends of the horizontal line with
\ centre x-coordinate YY(1 0), and length A in either direction from the centre
\ (so a total line length of 2 * A). In other words, this line:

\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the

\       Name: KILLSHP

\   Category: Universe
\    Summary: Remove a ship from our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Remove the ship in slot X from our local bubble of universe. This happens
\ when we kill a ship, collide with a ship and destroy it, or when a ship moves
\ outside our local bubble.
\
\ We also use this routine when we move out of range of the space station, in
\ which case we replace it with the sun.
\
\ When removing a ship, this creates a gap in the ship slots at FRIN, so we
\ shuffle all the later slots down to close the gap. We also shuffle the ship
\ data blocks at K% and ship line heap at WP, to reclaim all the memory that
\ the removed ship used to occupy.

\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\ This is part of the main game loop. This is where the core loop of the game
\ lives, and it's in two parts. The shorter loop (just parts 5 and 6) is
\ iterated when we are docked, while the entire loop from part 1 to 6 iterates
\ if we are in space.
\
\ This section covers the following:
\
\   * Spawn a trader, i.e. a Cobra Mk III, Python, Boa or Anaconda, with a 50%
\     chance of it having a missile, a 50% chance of it having an E.C.M., a 50%
\     chance of it docking and being aggressive if attacked, a speed between 16
\     and 31, and a gentle clockwise roll
\
\ We call this from within the main loop.

\       Name: BRBR
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: The standard BRKV handler for the game
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine in the decryption routine at DEEOR just before the
\ game is run for the first time, and at the end of the SVE routine after the
\ disc access menu has been processed. In other words, this is the standard
\ BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MEBRK for disc access
\ operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\    Summary: The BRKV handler for disc access operations
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages from the disc filing system
\ while disc access operations are being performed. When called, it makes a beep
\ and prints the system error message in the block pointed to by (&FD &FE),
\ which is where the disc filing system will put any disc errors (such as "File
\ not found", "Disc error" and so on). It then waits for a key press and returns
\ to the disc access menu.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine at the start of the SVE routine, just before the
\ disc access menu is shown, and it reverts to BRBR at the end of the SVE
\ routine after the disc access menu has been processed. In other words, BRBR is
\ the standard BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MEBRK for disc
\ access operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main difference between this routine and the standard BRKV
\ handler in BRBR is that this routine returns to the disc access menu rather
\ than restarting the game, and it doesn't decrement the brkd counter.

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Geometry)
\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.

\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Copy four sound bytes from SFX into XX16, interspersing them with null bytes,
\ with Y indicating the sound number to copy (from the values in the sound
\ table at SFX). So, for example, if we call this routine with A = 40 (long,
\ low beep), the following bytes will be set in XX16 to XX16+7:
\
\   &13 &00 &F4 &00 &0C &00 &08 &00
\
\ This block will be passed to OSWORD 7 to make the sound, which expects the
\ four sound attributes as 16-bit big-endian values - in other words, with the
\ low byte first. So the above block would pass the values &0013, &00F4, &000C
\ and &0008 to the SOUND statement when used with OSWORD 7, or:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\ Valid internal key numbers are Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers in the range
\ &10 top &79, so they're in the ranges &10 to &19, then &20 to &29, then &30 to
\ &39, and so on. This means that the other locations - i.e. &1A to &1F, &2A to
\ &2F and so on - aren't used by the lookup table, but the MOS doesn't let this
\ space go to waste; instead, those gaps contain MOS code, which is replicated
\ below as the table contains a copy of this entire block of the MOS, not just
\ the table entries.
\
\ This table allows code running on the parasite to convert internal key numbers
\ into ASCII codes in an efficient way. Without this table we would have to do a
\ lookup from the table in the I/O processor's MOS ROM, which we would have to
\ access from across the Tube, and this would be a lot slower than doing a
\ simple table lookup in the parasite's user RAM.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Multiplication and division using logarithms
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same logarithm algorithm that's documented in FMLTU,
\ except it subtracts the logarithm values, to do a division instead of a
\ multiplication.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the

\    Summary: Draw ship: Check if ship is exploding, check if ship is in front
\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws the current ship on the screen. This part checks to see if
\ the ship is exploding, or if it should start exploding, and if it does it sets
\ things up accordingly.
\
\ It also does some basic checks to see if we can see the ship, and if not it
\ removes it from the screen.
\
\ In this code, XX1 is used to point to the current ship's data block at INWK
\ (the two labels are interchangeable).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX1                 XX1 shares its location with INWK, which contains the
\                       zero-page copy of the data block for this ship from the
\                       K% workspace
\
\   INF                 The address of the data block for this ship in workspace
\                       K%
\
\   XX19(1 0)           XX19(1 0) shares its location with INWK(34 33), which
\                       contains the ship line heap address pointer
\
\   XX0                 The address of the blueprint for this ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   If NEEDKEY is non-zero, scan the keyboard for a key
\                       press and return the internal key number in X (or 0 for

\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.

\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section projects the coordinate of the vertex into screen coordinates and
\ stores them on the XX3 heap. By the end of this part, the XX3 heap contains
\ four bytes containing the 16-bit screen coordinates of the current vertex, in
\ the order: x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi.
\
\ When we reach here, we are looping through the vertices, and we've just worked
\ out the coordinates of the vertex in our normal coordinate system, as follows
\
\   XX15(2 0)           (x_sign x_lo) = x-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   XX15(5 3)           (y_sign y_lo) = y-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   (U T)               (z_sign z_lo) = z-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\ Note that U is always zero when we get to this point, as the vertex is always
\ in front of us (so it has a positive z-coordinate, into the screen).

\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Clip line: Work out which end-points are on-screen, if any
\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\
\                         * 0   = (x2, y2) on-screen
\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\  Deep dive: Rotating the universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We implement this using the same equations as in part 5 of MVEIT, where we
\ rotated the current ship's location by our pitch and roll. Specifically, the
\ calculation is as follows:
\
\   1. K2 = y - alpha * x
\   2. z = z + beta * K2
\   3. y = K2 - beta * z
\   4. x = x + alpha * y
\
\ See the deep dive on "Rotating the universe" for more details on the above.

\    Summary: Line definitions for characters in the Star Wars scroll text
\  Deep dive: The 6502 Second Processor demo mode
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Characters in the scroll text are drawn using lines on a 3x6 numbered grid
\ like this:
\
\   0   1   2
\   .   .   .
\   3   4   5
\   .   .   .
\   6   7   8
\   9   A   B
\
\ The low nibble of each byte is the starting point for that line segment, and
\ the high nibble is the end point, so a value of &28, for example, means
\ "draw a line from point 8 to point 2". This table contains definitions for all
\ the characters we can use in the scroll text, as lines on the above grid.
\
\ See the deep dive on "the 6502 Second Processor demo mode" for details.

\    Summary: Macro definition for standard tokens in the extended token table
\  Deep dive: Printing text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The following macro is used when building the recursive token table:
\
\   TOKN n              Insert recursive token [n]
\
\                         * Tokens 0-95 get stored as n + 160
\
\                         * Tokens 128-145 get stored as n - 114
\
\                         * Tokens 96-127 get stored as n
\
\ See the deep dive on "Printing text tokens" for details on how recursive
\ tokens are stored in the recursive token table.

\   * The RUPLA table contains the system numbers
\
\   * The RUGAL table contains the galaxy numbers and mission criteria
\
\   * The RUTOK table contains the extended token to display instead of the
\     normal extended description if the criteria in RUPLA and RUGAL are met
\
\ See the PDESC routine for details of how extended system descriptions work.

\
\ The ERND token type, which is part of the extended token system, takes an
\ argument between 0 and 37, and returns a randomly chosen token in the range
\ specified in this table. This is used to generate the extended description of
\ each system.
\
\ For example, the entry at position 13 in this table (counting from 0) is 66,
\ so ERND 14 will expand into a random token in the range 66-70, i.e. one of
\ "JUICE", "BRANDY", "WATER", "BREW" and "GARGLE BLASTERS".

\    Summary: Ship blueprints default NEWB flags
\  Deep dive: Ship blueprints
\             Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ When spawning a new ship, the bits from this table are applied to the new
\ ship's NEWB flags in byte #36 (i.e. a set bit in this table will set that bit
\ in the NEWB flags). In other words, if a ship blueprint is set to one of the
\ following, then all spawned ships of that type will be too: trader, bounty
\ hunter, hostile, pirate, innocent, cop.
\
\ The NEWB flags are as follows:
\
\   * Bit 0: Trader flag (0 = not a trader, 1 = trader)
\   * Bit 1: Bounty hunter flag (0 = not a bounty hunter, 1 = bounty hunter)
\   * Bit 2: Hostile flag (0 = not hostile, 1 = hostile)
\   * Bit 3: Pirate flag (0 = not a pirate, 1 = pirate)
\   * Bit 4: Docking flag (0 = not docking, 1 = docking)
\   * Bit 5: Innocent bystander (0 = normal, 1 = innocent bystander)
\   * Bit 6: Cop flag (0 = not a cop, 1 = cop)
\   * Bit 7: For spawned ships: ship been scooped or has docked
\             For blueprints: this ship type has an escape pod fitted
\
\ See the deep dive on "Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags" for details of
\ how this works.
