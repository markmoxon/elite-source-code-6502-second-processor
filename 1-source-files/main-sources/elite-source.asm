\
\ This lookup table contains sine values for the first half of a circle, from 0
\ to 180 degrees (0 to PI radians). In terms of circle or ellipse line segments,
\ there are 64 segments in a circle, so this contains sine values for segments
\ 0 to 31.
\
\ In terms of segments, to calculate the sine of the angle at segment x, we look
\ up the value in SNE + x, and to calculate the cosine of the angle we look up
\ the value in SNE + ((x + 16) mod 32).
\
\ In terms of radians, to calculate the following:
\
\   sin(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, we look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + (theta * 10)
\
\ To calculate the following:
\
\   cos(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + ((theta * 10) + 16) mod 32
\
\ Theta must be between 0 and 3.1 radians, so theta * 10 is between 0 and 31.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains lookup values for arctangent calculations involving angles
\ in the range 0 to 45 degrees (or 0 to PI / 4 radians).
\
\ To calculate the value of theta in the following:
\
\   theta = arctan(t)
\
\ where 0 <= t < 1, we look up the value in:
\
\   ACT + (t * 32)
\
\ The result will be an integer representing the angle in radians, where 256
\ represents a full circle of 360 degrees (2 * PI radians). The result of the
\ lookup will therefore be an integer in the range 0 to 31, as this represents
\ 0 to 45 degrees (0 to PI / 4 radians).
\
\ The table does not support values of t >= 1 or t < 0 directly, so if we need
\ to calculate the arctangent for an angle greater than 45 degrees, we can apply
\ the following calculation to the result from the table:
\
\   * For t > 1, arctan(t) = 64 - arctan(1 / t)
\
\ For negative values of t where -1 < t < 0, we can apply the following
\ calculation to the result from the table:
\
\   * For t < 0, arctan(-t) = 128 - arctan(t)
\
\ Finally, if t < -1, we can do the first calculation to get arctan(|t|), and
\ the second to get arctan(-|t|).

                        \ pulses of a pulse laser. It is set as follows:
                        \
                        \   * 0 for a beam laser

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * Space and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * TAB to fire an energy bomb
\   * ESCAPE to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\
\ Two-letter token lookup table for tokens 128-159. See the deep dive on
\ "Printing text tokens" for details of how the two-letter token system works.
\
\ These two-letter tokens can also be used in the extended text token system, by
\ adding 100 to the token number. So the extended two-letter token 228 is "AL",
\ the same as the standard two-letter token 128. In this system, the last four
\ tokens are not available, as they would have numbers greater than 255.

\       Name: BLINE
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing circles
\    Summary: Draw a circle segment and add it to the ball line heap
\  Deep dive: The ball line heap
\             Drawing circles
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw a single segment of a circle by adding the point to the ball line heap,
\ so it can be sent to the I/O processor for drawing once the whole circle has
\ been added to the heap.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   CNT                 The number of this segment
\
\   STP                 The step size for the circle
\
\   K6(1 0)             The x-coordinate of the new point on the circle, as
\                       a screen coordinate
\
\   (T X)               The y-coordinate of the new point on the circle, as
\                       an offset from the centre of the circle
\
\   FLAG                Set to &FF for the first call, so it sets up the first
\                       point in the heap but waits until the second call before
\                       drawing anything (as we need two points, i.e. two calls,
\                       before we can draw a line)
\
\   K4(1 0)             Pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\   K5(1 0)             Screen x-coordinate of the previous point added to the
\                       ball line heap (if this is not the first point)
\
\   K5(3 2)             Screen y-coordinate of the previous point added to the
\                       ball line heap (if this is not the first point)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   CNT                 CNT is updated to CNT + STP
\
\   A                   The new value of CNT
\
\   K5(1 0)             Screen x-coordinate of the point that we just added to
\                       the ball line heap
\
\   K5(3 2)             Screen y-coordinate of the point that we just added to
\                       the ball line heap
\
\   FLAG                Set to 0

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the front view".

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\    Summary: The size of the justified text buffer at BUF
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ When justified text is enabled by jump token 14, {justify}, during printing of
\ extended text tokens, text is fed into a buffer at BUF instead of being
\ printed straight away, so it can be padded out with spaces to justify the
\ text. DTW5 contains the size of the buffer, so BUF + DTW5 points to the first
\ free byte after the end of the buffer.

\             extended text tokens
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is used to indicate whether lower case is currently enabled. It
\ has two values:
\
\   * %10000000 = lower case is enabled
\
\   * %00000000 = lower case is not enabled
\
\ The default value is %00000000 (lower case is not enabled).
\
\ The flag is set to %10000000 (lower case is enabled) by jump token 13 {lower
\ case}, which calls routine MT10 to change the value of DTW6.
\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (lower case is not enabled) by jump token 1, {all
\ caps}, and jump token 2, {sentence case}, which call routines MT1 and MT2 to
\ change the value of DTW6.

\    Summary: A mask for capitalising the next letter in an extended text token
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is only used by one specific extended token, the {single cap}
\ jump token, which capitalises the next letter only. It has two values:
\
\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\
\   * %11111111 = do not change case
\
\ The default value is %11111111 (do not change case).
\
\ The flag is set to %11011111 (capitalise the next letter) by jump token 19,
\ {single cap}, which calls routine MT19 to change the value of DTW.
\
\ The flag is set to %11111111 (do not change case) at the start of DASC, after
\ the letter has been capitalised in DETOK2, so the effect is to capitalise one
\ letter only.
\
\ The letter to print is AND'd with DTW8 in DETOK2, which capitalises the letter
\ by clearing bit 5 (if DTW8 is %11011111). However, this AND is only done if at
\ least one of the following is true:
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW2 is set (we are not currently printing a word)
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW6 is set (lower case has been enabled by jump token 13, {lower
\     case}
\
\ In other words, we only capitalise the next letter if it's the first letter in
\ a word, or we are printing in lower case.

\    Summary: Draw the ships in the ship hangar, then draw the hangar by sending
\             an OSWORD 248 command to the I/O processor
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Half the time this will draw one of the four pre-defined ship hangar groups in
\ HATB, and half the time this will draw a solitary Sidewinder, Mamba, Krait or
\ Adder on a random position. In all cases, the ships will be randomly spun
\ around on the ground so they can face in any direction, and larger ships are
\ drawn higher up off the ground than smaller ships.
\
\ The ships are drawn by the HAS1 routine, which uses the normal ship-drawing
\ routine in LL9, and then the hangar background is drawn by sending an OSWORD
\ 248 command to the I/O processor.

\
\ This section implements missile tactics and is entered at TA18 from the main
\ entry point below, if the current ship is a missile. Specifically:
\
\   * If E.C.M. is active, destroy the missile
\
\   * If the missile is hostile towards us, then check how close it is. If it
\     hasn't reached us, jump to part 3 so it can streak towards us, otherwise
\     we've been hit, so process a large amount of damage to our ship
\
\   * Otherwise see how close the missile is to its target. If it has not yet
\     reached its target, give the target a chance to activate its E.C.M. if it
\     has one, otherwise jump to TA19 with K3 set to the vector from the target
\     to the missile
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is the space station, destroy
\     the missile, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is a ship, destroy the missile
\     and the ship, potentially damaging us if we are nearby

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Flight
\    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
\ the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
\ in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
\
\ Specifically, it calculates the following:
\
\   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\ where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
\ vector for the space station.
\
\ The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
\ -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
\ way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
\ vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
\ of the station to the ship.
\
\ In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
\ actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
\
\ Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
\ the point in front of the station slot.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position
\                       (4 unit vectors from the centre of the station for each
\                       call to DCS1, so two calls will return the vector to a
\                       point that's 8 unit vectors from the centre of the
\                       station)

\       Name: STARS2
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the left or right view
\  Deep dive: Stardust in the side views
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This moves the stardust sideways according to our speed and which side we are
\ looking out of, and applies our current pitch and roll to each particle of
\ dust, so the stardust moves correctly when we steer our ship.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. delta_x = 8 * 256 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x + delta_x
\
\   3. x = x + beta * y
\   4. y = y - beta * x
\
\   5. x = x - alpha * x * y
\   6. y = y + alpha * y * y + alpha
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the side views".
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The view to process:
\
\                         * X = 1 for left view

\    Summary: Calculate (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.

\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0) = (A P+1 P) / (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ The actual division here is done as an 8-bit calculation using LL31, but this
\ routine shifts both the numerator (the top part of the division) and the
\ denominator (the bottom part of the division) around to get the multi-byte
\ result we want.
\
\ Specifically, it shifts both of them to the left as far as possible, keeping a
\ tally of how many shifts get done in each one - and specifically, the
\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then
\ divides the two highest bytes with the simple 8-bit routine in LL31, and
\ shifts the result by the difference in the number of shifts, which acts as a
\ scale factor to get the correct result.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0)          The result of the division
\
\   X                   X is preserved

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant
\ locations. Specifically, this routine calculates the following from the three
\ 16-bit seeds in QQ15 (using only s0_hi, s1_hi and s1_lo):
\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\    Summary: Move galactic coordinates by a signed delta
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Move an 8-bit galactic coordinate by a certain distance in either direction
\ (i.e. a signed 8-bit delta), but only if it doesn't cause the coordinate to
\ overflow. The coordinate is in a single axis, so it's either an x-coordinate
\ or a y-coordinate.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The galactic coordinate to update
\
\   QQ19+3              The delta (can be positive or negative)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   QQ19+4              The updated coordinate after moving by the delta (this
\                       will be the same as A if moving by the delta overflows)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)

\
\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Project the current ship's location or the planet onto the screen, either
\ returning the screen coordinates of the projection (if it's on-screen), or
\ returning an error via the C flag.
\
\ In this context, "on-screen" means that the point is projected into the
\ following range:
\
\   centre of screen - 1024 < x < centre of screen + 1024
\   centre of screen - 1024 < y < centre of screen + 1024
\
\ This is to cater for ships (and, more likely, planets and suns) whose centres
\ are off-screen but whose edges may still be visible.
\
\ The projection calculation is:
\
\   K3(1 0) = #X + x / z
\   K4(1 0) = #Y + y / z
\
\ where #X and #Y are the pixel x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the centre of

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division of a specified value from one of the
\ orientation vectors (in this example, nosev_x):
\
\   (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ where z is the z-coordinate of the planet from INWK. The result is an 8-bit
\ magnitude in A, with maximum value 254, and just a sign bit (bit 7) in Y.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 9, 11, 13: divides nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z
\
\                         * X = 15, 17, 19: divides roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z
\
\                         * X = 21, 23, 25: divides sidev_x, sidev_y, sidev_z
\

\    Summary: Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse
\  Deep dive: Drawing ellipses
\             Drawing meridians and equators
\             Drawing craters
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse, to be used for the planet's equator and
\ meridian (in which case we draw half an ellipse), or crater (in which case we
\ draw a full ellipse).
\
\ The ellipse is defined by a centre point, plus two conjugate radius vectors,
\ u and v, where:
\
\   u = [ u_x ]       v = [ v_x ]
\       [ u_y ]           [ v_y ]
\
\ The individual components of these 2D vectors (i.e. u_x, u_y etc.) are 16-bit
\ sign-magnitude numbers, where the high bytes contain only the sign bit (in
\ bit 7), with bits 0 to 6 being clear. This means that as we store u_x as
\ (XX16 K2), for example, we know that |u_x| = K2.
\
\ This routine calls BLINE to draw each line segment in the ellipse, passing the
\ coordinates as follows:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + u_x * cos(CNT2) + v_x * sin(CNT2)
\
\   K6(3 2) = K4(1 0) - u_y * cos(CNT2) - v_y * sin(CNT2)
\
\ The y-coordinates are negated because BLINE expects pixel coordinates but the
\ u and v vectors are extracted from the orientation vector. The y-axis runs
\ in the opposite direction in 3D space to that on the screen, so we need to
\ negate the 3D space coordinates before we can combine them with the ellipse's
\ centre coordinates.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(1 0)              The planet's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   K4(1 0)             The pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   (XX16 K2)           The x-component of u (i.e. u_x), where XX16 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+1 K2+1)       The y-component of u (i.e. u_y), where XX16+1 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+2 K2+2)       The x-component of v (i.e. v_x), where XX16+2 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\

\

\
\                         * 64 for a full ellipse (a crater)

\             line by line
\  Deep dive: Drawing the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:
\
\   (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ though in reality only (Y A) is used.
\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the
\ routine is only called with X = 15, and then again after X has been
\ incremented to 17. So the values calculated by PLS1 use roofv_x first, then
\ roofv_y. The comments below refer to roofv_x, for the first call.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 15: divides roofv_x
\
\                         * X = 17: divides roofv_y
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next
\                       coordinate in this orientation vector (so consecutive
\                       calls to the routine will start with x, then move onto y
\                       and then z)

 STA (INF),Y            \ and store it in byte #35 of the destination's block

                        \ in byte #32) and then start looping

 STA INF                \ again, INF will correctly point to the destination for
 LDA SC+1               \ the next iteration
 STA INF+1

 LDY T                  \ Now we want to move the contents of the heap, as all
                        \ we did above was to update the pointers, so first
                        \ we set a counter in Y that is initially set to T

                        \
                        \ As a reminder, we have already set the following:

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\ Work out how bad we are from the amount of contraband in our hold. The

\   (slaves + narcotics) * 2 + firearms
\
\ so slaves and narcotics are twice as illegal as firearms. The value in FIST
\ (our legal status) is set to at least this value whenever we launch from a

\ station carrying 25 tonnes of slaves/narcotics, or 50 tonnes of firearms
\ across multiple trips, is enough to make us a fugitive.

\       Name: BRBR
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: The standard BRKV handler for the game
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine in the decryption routine at DEEOR just before the
\ game is run for the first time, and at the end of the SVE routine after the
\ disc access menu has been processed. In other words, this is the standard
\ BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MEBRK for disc access
\ operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\    Summary: The BRKV handler for disc access operations
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages from the disc filing system
\ while disc access operations are being performed. When called, it makes a beep
\ and prints the system error message in the block pointed to by (&FD &FE),
\ which is where the disc filing system will put any disc errors (such as "File
\ not found", "Disc error" and so on). It then waits for a key press and returns
\ to the disc access menu.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine at the start of the SVE routine, just before the
\ disc access menu is shown, and it reverts to BRBR at the end of the SVE
\ routine after the disc access menu has been processed. In other words, BRBR is
\ the standard BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MEBRK for disc
\ access operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main difference between this routine and the standard BRKV
\ handler in BRBR is that this routine returns to the disc access menu rather
\ than restarting the game, and it doesn't decrement the brkd counter.

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in XX15
\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&60) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                The vector to normalise, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1
\
\                         * The z-coordinate in XX15+2
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector

\       Name: DKS3
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Keyboard
\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The Executive version supports two additional configuration options:
\
\   * @ toggles infinite jump range and fuel (&47)
\   * : toggles speech (&48)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The internal number of the configuration key to check
\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to
\                       &46)

                        \ on/off keys are dealt with elsewhere, as the internal
                        \ key for S and Q are &51 and &10, which don't fit

\    Summary: Orthonormalise the orientation vectors for a ship
\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\    Summary: The key logger buffer that gets updated by the OSWORD 240 command
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ KTRAN is a buffer that is filled with key logger information by the KEYBOARD
\ routine in the I/O processor, which is run when the parasite sends an OSWORD
\ &F0 command to the I/O processor. The buffer contains details of keys being
\ pressed, with KTRAN being filled with bytes #2 to #14 from the KEYBOARD
\ routine (because KEYBOARD is called with OSSC pointing to buf, and buf is
\ equal to KTRAN - 2).
\
\ The key logger buffer is filled as follows:
\
\   KTRAN + 0           Internal key number of any non-primary flight control
\                       key that is being pressed

\

\

\    Summary: Translation table from internal key number to ASCII
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is a copy of the keyboard translation table from the BBC Micro's MOS 1.20
\ ROM. The value at offset n is the lower-case ASCII value of the key with
\ internal key number n, so for example the value at offset &10 is &71, which is
\ 113, or ASCII "q", so internal key number &10 is the key number of the "Q"
\ key.
\
\ Valid internal key numbers are Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers in the range
\ &10 top &79, so they're in the ranges &10 to &19, then &20 to &29, then &30 to
\ &39, and so on. This means that the other locations - i.e. &1A to &1F, &2A to
\ &2F and so on - aren't used by the lookup table, but the MOS doesn't let this
\ space go to waste; instead, those gaps contain MOS code, which is replicated
\ below as the table contains a copy of this entire block of the MOS, not just
\ the table entries.
\
\ This table allows code running on the parasite to convert internal key numbers
\ into ASCII codes in an efficient way. Without this table we would have to do a
\ lookup from the table in the I/O processor's MOS ROM, which we would have to
\ access from across the Tube, and this would be a lot slower than doing a
\ simple table lookup in the parasite's user RAM.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Multiplication and division using logarithms
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same logarithm algorithm that's documented in FMLTU,
\ except it subtracts the logarithm values, to do a division instead of a
\ multiplication.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the

\
\ This routine draws the current ship on the screen. This part checks to see if

                        \ The first task is to set up the inverse matrix, ready
                        \ for us to send to the dot product routine at LL51.
                        \ Back up in part 3, we set up the following variables:

\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a ship line using smooth animation, by drawing the ship's new
\             line and erasing the corresponding old line from the screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine implements smoother ship animation by erasing and redrawing each
\ individual line in the ship, rather than the approach in the other Acornsoft
\ versions of the game, which erase the entire existing ship before drawing the
\ new one.
\
\ Here's the new approach in this routine:
\
\   * Draw the new line
\
\   * Fetch the corresponding existing line (in position LSNUM) from the heap
\
\   * Store the new line in the heap at this position, replacing the old one
\
\   * If the existing line we just took from the heap is on-screen, erase it
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   LSNUM               The offset within the line heap where we add the new
\                       line's coordinates
\
\   X1                  The screen x-coordinate of the start of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   Y1                  The screen y-coordinate of the start of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   X2                  The screen x-coordinate of the end of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   Y2                  The screen y-coordinate of the end of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   XX19(1 0)           XX19(1 0) shares its location with INWK(34 33), which
\                       contains the ship line heap address pointer
\
\ Returns:

\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Clip line: Work out which end-points are on-screen, if any
\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\
\                         * 0   = (x2, y2) on-screen
\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\  Deep dive: Rotating the universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We implement this using the same equations as in part 5 of MVEIT, where we
\ rotated the current ship's location by our pitch and roll. Specifically, the
\ calculation is as follows:
\
\   1. K2 = y - alpha * x
\   2. z = z + beta * K2
\   3. y = K2 - beta * z
\   4. x = x + alpha * y
\
\ See the deep dive on "Rotating the universe" for more details on the above.

\    Summary: Line definitions for characters in the Star Wars scroll text
\  Deep dive: The 6502 Second Processor demo mode
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Characters in the scroll text are drawn using lines on a 3x6 numbered grid
\ like this:
\
\   0   1   2
\   .   .   .
\   3   4   5
\   .   .   .
\   6   7   8
\   9   A   B
\
\ The low nibble of each byte is the starting point for that line segment, and
\ the high nibble is the end point, so a value of &28, for example, means
\ "draw a line from point 8 to point 2". This table contains definitions for all
\ the characters we can use in the scroll text, as lines on the above grid.
\
\ See the deep dive on "the 6502 Second Processor demo mode" for details.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains the criteria for printing an extended description override
\ for a system. The galaxy number is in bits 0-6, while bit 7 determines whether
\ to show this token during mission 1 only (bit 7 is clear, i.e. a value of &0x
\ in the table below), or all of the time (bit 7 is set, i.e. a value of &8x in
\ the table below).
\
\ In other words, Teorge, Arredi, Anreer and Lave have extended description
\ overrides that are always shown, while the rest only appear when mission 1 is
\ in progress.
\
\ The three variables work as follows:
\
\   * The RUPLA table contains the system numbers
\
\   * The RUGAL table contains the galaxy numbers and mission criteria
\
\   * The RUTOK table contains the extended token to display instead of the

\    Summary: The second extended token table for recursive tokens 0-26 (DETOK3)
\  Deep dive: Extended system descriptions
\             Extended text tokens
\             The Constrictor mission
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Contains the tokens for extended description overrides of systems that match
\ the system number in RUPLA and the conditions in RUGAL.
\
\ The three variables work as follows:
\
\   * The RUPLA table contains the system numbers
\
\   * The RUGAL table contains the galaxy numbers and mission criteria
\
\   * The RUTOK table contains the extended token to display instead of the
\     normal extended description if the criteria in RUPLA and RUGAL are met
\
\ See the PDESC routine for details of how extended system descriptions work.

\ For example, the entry at position 13 in this table (counting from 0) is 66,

\  Deep dive: Ship blueprints
\             Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ When spawning a new ship, the bits from this table are applied to the new
\ ship's NEWB flags in byte #36 (i.e. a set bit in this table will set that bit
\ in the NEWB flags). In other words, if a ship blueprint is set to one of the
\ following, then all spawned ships of that type will be too: trader, bounty
\ hunter, hostile, pirate, innocent, cop.
\
\ The NEWB flags are as follows:
\
\   * Bit 0: Trader flag (0 = not a trader, 1 = trader)
\   * Bit 1: Bounty hunter flag (0 = not a bounty hunter, 1 = bounty hunter)
\   * Bit 2: Hostile flag (0 = not hostile, 1 = hostile)
\   * Bit 3: Pirate flag (0 = not a pirate, 1 = pirate)
\   * Bit 4: Docking flag (0 = not docking, 1 = docking)
\   * Bit 5: Innocent bystander (0 = normal, 1 = innocent bystander)
\   * Bit 6: Cop flag (0 = not a cop, 1 = cop)
\   * Bit 7: For spawned ships: ship been scooped or has docked
\             For blueprints: this ship type has an escape pod fitted
\
\ See the deep dive on "Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags" for details of
\ how this works.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ To create a very simple parallax effect, we add a multiple of the high byte of
\ the following, which gives us the distance between a point in space and the
\ projection plane:
\
\   zCoord(1 0) - zPlane(1 0)
\
\ We apply this value to the x-coordinates, according to whether the point is
\ beyond the projection plane or this side of it.
\
\ Points beyond the projection plane are said to have positive parallax and the
\ value above is positive, and the left (red) eye moves left and the right
\ (cyan) eye moves right.
\
\ Points this side of the projection plane are said to have negative parallax
\ and the value above is negative, and the left (red) eye moves right and the
\ right (cyan) eye moves left.

\
\ Arguments:

\   X                   The index into the XX3 and XX3r line heaps, pointing to
\                       the second byte of the x-coordinate we just added, which
\                       gets updated with the new x-coordinates in both eyes
\
\                       If X = &FF then the heaps are not updated (so set this
